# udacity_tv_script_generation

# Description:
This project involved creating a trained RNN using LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) on a Seinfeld TV script (tv script file is under data/Seinfeld_Scripts.txt). After the training process, the RNN was used to generate a fake TV script based upon the Seinfeld script. Below is a sample from the generated fake tv script. As you can see, the RNN model was able to pickup on different patterns regarding phrases, punctuation, and even humourous concepts within the script.
